PUTE [ file ]
    Put data into the EPG list. The data entered has to strictly follow the
    format defined in vdr(5) for the 'epg.data' file.  A '.' on a line
    by itself terminates the input and starts processing of the data (all
    entered data is buffered until the terminating '.' is seen).
    If a file name is given, epg data will be read from this file (which
    must be accessible under the given name from the machine VDR is running
    on). In case of file input, no terminating '.' shall be given.
