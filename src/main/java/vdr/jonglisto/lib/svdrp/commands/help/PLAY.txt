PLAY <number> [ begin | <position> ]
    Play the recording with the given number. Before a recording can be
    played, an LSTR command must have been executed in order to retrieve
    the recording numbers.
    The keyword 'begin' plays the recording from its very beginning, while
    a <position> (given as hh:mm:ss[.ff] or framenumber) starts at that
    position. If neither 'begin' nor a <position> are given, replay is resumed
    at the position where any previous replay was stopped, or from the beginning
    by default. To control or stop the replay session, use the usual remote
    control keypresses via the HITK command.
