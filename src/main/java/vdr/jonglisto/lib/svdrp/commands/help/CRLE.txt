CLRE [ <number> | <name> | <id> ]
    Clear the EPG list of the given channel number, name or id.
    Without option it clears the entire EPG list.
    After a CLRE command, no further EPG processing is done for 10
    seconds, so that data sent with subsequent PUTE commands doesn't
    interfere with data from the broadcasters.
