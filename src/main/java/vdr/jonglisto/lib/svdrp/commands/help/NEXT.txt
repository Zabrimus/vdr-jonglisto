NEXT [ abs | rel ]
    Show the next timer event. If no option is given, the output will be
    in human readable form. With option 'abs' the absolute time of the next
    event will be given as the number of seconds since the epoch (time_t
    format), while with option 'rel' the relative time will be given as the
    number of seconds from now until the event. If the absolute time given
    is smaller than the current time, or if the relative time is less than
    zero, this means that the timer is currently recording and has started
    at the given time. The first value in the resulting line is the number
    of the timer.
