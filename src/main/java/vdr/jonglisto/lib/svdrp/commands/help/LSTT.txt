LSTT [ <number> ] [ id ]
    List timers. Without option, all timers are listed. Otherwise
    only the given timer is listed. If the keyword 'id' is given, the
    channels will be listed with their unique channel ids instead of
    their numbers. This command lists only the timers that are defined
    locally on this VDR, not any remote timers from other VDRs.
