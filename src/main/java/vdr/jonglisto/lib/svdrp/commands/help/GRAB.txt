GRAB <filename> [ <quality> [ <sizex> <sizey> ] ]
    Grab the current frame and save it to the given file. Images can
    be stored as JPEG or PNM, depending on the given file name extension.
    The quality of the grabbed image can be in the range 0..100, where 100
    (the default) means \"best\" (only applies to JPEG). The size parameters
    define the size of the resulting image (default is full screen).
    If the file name is just an extension (.jpg, .jpeg or .pnm) the image
    data will be sent to the SVDRP connection encoded in base64. The same
    happens if '-' (a minus sign) is given as file name, in which case the
    image format defaults to JPEG.");
