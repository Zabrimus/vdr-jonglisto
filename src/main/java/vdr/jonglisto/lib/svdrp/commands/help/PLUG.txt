PLUG <name> [ help | main ] [ <command> [ <options> ]]
    Send a command to a plugin.
    The PLUG command without any parameters lists all plugins.
    If only a name is given, all commands known to that plugin are listed.
    If a command is given (optionally followed by parameters), that command
    is sent to the plugin, and the result will be displayed.
    The keyword 'help' lists all the SVDRP commands known to the named plugin.
    If 'help' is followed by a command, the detailed help for that command is
    given. The keyword 'main' initiates a call to the main menu function of the
    given plugin.
